                    <p ><span class="txt6"><Big><B>STS-87</B></Big> Columbia mission took place from November 19 to December 5, 1997. It marked the fourth U.S Microgravity Payload flight, focusing on experiments aimed at understanding the effects of weightlessness on various physical processes and observing the Sun's outer atmospheric layers. During the mission, two crew members conducted an Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) or spacewalk, which included manually capturing a Spartan satellite and testing tools and procedures for future Space Station assembly. STS-87 completed 252 orbits of the Earth, covering a distance of 6.5 million miles in 376 hours and 34 minutes.</span>
